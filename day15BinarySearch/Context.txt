**Binary Search**
--> Make sure the array should be sorted to perform binary search.
steps:

1. Initialize left pointer to 0 and right poinetr at n-1. run the loop from left to right and break the loop when left and right pointer crosses eachother.
2. find the middle value of the array using the formula mid = left+(right-left)/2. 
3. compare the middle value with the target value. If the middle value is equal to the target value,return mid.
4. If the middle value is less than the target value, update the left pointer to mid+1. as definitely element will be present in right half.
5. If the middle value is greater than the target value, update the right pointer to mid-1. as definitely target will belong to first half of the array.
6. repeat the steps 2-5 until the target value is found or the left pointer crosses
