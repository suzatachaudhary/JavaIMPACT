Recursion-means function calling itself until base condition is met.
2 types.
1--function calling same function itself and itself.
2--function calling another function itself and itself.
in java we don't have pointers. we can't use reference.so java is strictly passed by value.
if we didn't  mention base case properly we will get an exception.
if we didn't mention base case properly we will get an exception called stack overflow.


#in strings we have a method called charAt
str.charAt(4)  // hello output--o.

##Reverse using Recursion(String)
-->  before this problem we have to know
      -charAt(index)
      -substring(index) exp str.substring(1)  //hello output will be ello. means string start from 1 -means index only.

      so steps are 
      1.take the first index i.e charAt(0), store in ch==  and compare with target character.
      if it is equal ignore if not append, and move to next index i.e substring(1) and repeat the same process.
