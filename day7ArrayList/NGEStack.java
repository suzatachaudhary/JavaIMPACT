//#Monotonic stack
// --> Stack in the sense last in first out.
// --push():push operation means adding the element onto the stack.
// --> pop(): pop operation removing top most element from the stack.
// --> peek(): printing top most element of the stack.

// ##Next greater element.

//if solved using stack element.
//if stack is empty return -1 qnd push the element into the stack .
//if array element<stack element, then return stack element.and push array element on to stack.
//if peek element is smaller pop it .then again compare with arr element and next stack element then return if stack element greater or else it become empty then again return -1.
//follow same 
// this is called monotonic stack.
