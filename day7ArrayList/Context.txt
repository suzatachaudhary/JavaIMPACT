//#Monotonic stack
// --> Stack in the sense last in first out.
// --push():push operation means adding the element onto the stack.
// --> pop(): pop operation removing top most element from the stack.
// --> peek(): printing top most element of the stack.

// ##Next greater element.

//if solved using stack element.
//if stack is empty return -1 qnd push the element into the stack .
//if array element<stack element, then return stack element.and push array element on to stack.
//if peek element is smaller pop it .then again compare with arr element and next stack element then return if stack element greater or else it become empty then again return -1.
//follow same 
// this is called monotonic stack.

##Array List
Array having fixed size we can't increased the size as well as we can't decrease.
if arr[5] we can only store 5 element . if we want to add 6 element we have to create one more array with extra size but we can't increased the size
but
In ArrayList the size will be dynamic, You can increase the size as well as decrease.

Syntax:
List<Integer> arr= new ArrayList<>();
List<Wrapper class of list type> ArrayListName=new ArrayList<>();
//all list comes on collection but most of the array problem solved with ArrayList.

// if array is initialized with size 2 and we are trying to add 3rd element the size of array will be doubled .if the size of array is 4  and we are trying to add 5th element the size will be doubled to 8 and vice versa. if array size is 8 and if we removed 4 elements out of 8 , and we trying to remove 5th element
the array size becomes half.

#Example how it works.
arr[4] 1,2,3,4 --> if 5 is added the size will be automatically arr[8]
arr[8] 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8--> removed 1,2,3,4 still arr size will still be arr[8] but if 5 is also removed the size will be automatically arr[4] i.e half.
