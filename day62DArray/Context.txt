#2d Array consist of rows and columns
Syntax of 2D Array

int[][] arr=new int[3][];
int[][] arr=new int[][];  -wrong as number of row is not specified.

-> the first square brackets represent rows and second square brackets represent columns.
-> While declaring the array , we need to specify the number of rows and to mention number of columns is optional.

#Size and length
arr[5]={1,2,3}  // size-max element you can store and length -actual number of elements in array.
each and every row column can be different then it is zagged array.

{
  {1,2,3},
  {4,5,6},
  {7,8,9}  sum of zigzag elements-->1,2,3,5,7,8,9.=35
}

#Ques : take square matrix rotate 90 degrees.
